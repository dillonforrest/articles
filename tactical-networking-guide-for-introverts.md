# the tactical networking guide for introverts

an intro from a friend is always best
- a network is an asset which compounds over time. start building it sooner rather than later to reap rewards sooner rather than later.
- be a good friend. be happy to help other people and ask nothing in return. then, if or when you want an introduction, you'll be asking a friend. it won't be an awkward request from somebody who hasn't spoken to you in years.
- be genuinely interested in helping people yourself. are you a selfish asshole? do you talk like an asshole? if yes to either of those questions, then this is not the guide for you. you need the tactical networking guide for assholes. we want to be cool, helpful people here.

learn how to find anybody's email address:
- https://www.distilled.net/blog/miscellaneous/find-almost-anybodys-email-address/
- don't forget to check if they have a personal website with an email
- you can frequently guess their gmail address by taking their twitter, linkedin, or github ids and putting them in @gmail.com

send an email that people will open and reply to:
- there are three steps to the cold email funnel: finding an email address, getting the cold email opened, and getting a reply to your cold email
- opening: short subject. i like "quick question," which i got from steli efti's ebook on startup sales. i still use it. it works really well. feel free to use it yourself.
- email body should be less than 300 words. don't ramble, because long emails are more difficult to read than short emails.
- have a specific call to action. if you're asking for a favor or a question, make sure that question or favor is highlighted in some way, not drowning in your paragraphs. this is your call to action. have an explicit call to action. otherwise, a reply will be difficult.
- include a brief background about yourself. you can share your commonality with the person, and they'll be more likely to reply to you
- don't ask more than 3 questions. 1-2 is better. you don't know this person well enough to have earned their attention towards 3 questions.
- if you want to just pick somebody's brain and just broadly hear their thoughts, i like to ask them a modified version of the NPS survey: how would you rate XYZ on a scale from 1-5? what is the reasoning behind your rating?

the reply to the reply:
- if you have more questions to ask, this is the right time to do it. you've built enough of a relationship, so keep asking
- don't forget to thank them for their time. don't disrespect people's time.
- offer to keep them in the loop and stay in touch
- offer to return the favor

the follow-up:
- this is the most vital part of networking: follow up!!!
- this is how you solidify relationships. by not following up, you make people feel like you were sleazy.

that's it
- does that look simple? it is simple.
- does this just look like a guide just for sending email? yeah, basically. you're an introvert though, right? you prefer email over meeting in person or chatting on the phone, right?
